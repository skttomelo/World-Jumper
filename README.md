# World-Jumper
This project is a little prototype that I used to help me learn about java in a fun way back when I started highschool in 2013. Essentially it's just a a bunch of sprites I drew that move around, and with the wonky controls I provide you can punch all but the dude in the green jumpsuit. Other than that I tried to use this prototype to learn how to do collisions, but didn't hit the mark when it came to object collisions such as the player and the floating ground objects above him. I've included extra text files I wrote back in highschool for this project to help show my progress and issues with this prototype.
# What I learned
* The basics of Java at this point
* Basic Object Oriented Design
* How to render things to a JFrame
* How to read in images and split bigger images into smaller images for the player and mobs
* basic animation system (Not really that, just learned how to cycle through images to provide animations)
* key inputs
* layer enemy collisions for attacking (comparing rectangles)
* ArrayLists
* The dangers of multithreading if done by an inexperienced person (in the beginning when I first made this prototype I made everything have it's own thread which was not good practice)
